# Simple Binary Tree in C (Educational Exercise)

This project implements a basic binary tree in C, focusing on:

- Defining a simple `struct node`
- Printing the tree using in-order visit
- Basic terminal visualization
- Basic svg visualization

---

## Background

This code was written as a practice exercise for a university course in **Data Structures and Algorithms**. The goal is to get comfortable with:

- Pointers and dynamic memory allocation
- Recursive functions
- Tree traversal and node structures

---

## Compile and Run

To compile and run the program:

```sh
gcc bst.c -o tree
./bst
```

## Author and Help
Jacopo di Lauro, University of Padua. 
I took inspiration from a part of the code in this youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-RtvJKffq0) because I didnâ€™t know how to draw a binary tree in an SVG file.
