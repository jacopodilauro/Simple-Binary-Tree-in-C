## ðŸŒ³ Simple Binary Tree in C (Educational Exercise)
A simple and clear `struct node` for the binary tree.
*   **In-Order Traversal:** A function to print the tree's nodes in ascending order.
*   **Terminal Visualization:** A basic text-based representation of the tree structure in the terminal.
*   **SVG Visualization:** Generates an SVG file (`tree.svg`) for a clean, graphical view of the tree.

### Prerequisites

You will need a C compiler, such as `gcc`, installed on your system.

### Installation & Execution

1.  **Clone the repository (remember to replace with your details):**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/jacopodilauro/Simple-Binary-Tree-in-C
    cd Simple-Binary-Tree-in-C
    ```

2.  **Compile the source code:**
    ```sh
    gcc bst.c -o tree
    ```

3.  **Run the executable:**
    ```sh
    ./tree
    ```

##  Visualizations

The program provides two ways to visualize the binary tree:

### Terminal Output

After running the executable, the tree will be printed directly to your terminal.

### SVG Image

The program also generates an SVG file named `tree.svg` in the root directory. You can open this file in any modern web browser to see a graphical representation of the tree.

I took inspiration from a part of the code in this youtube video [Esadecimale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-RtvJKffq0) because I didnâ€™t know how to draw a binary tree in an SVG file.
