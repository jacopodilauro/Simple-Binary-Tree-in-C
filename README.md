# Simple Binary Tree in C (Educational Exercise)

This project implements a basic binary tree in C, focusing on:

- Defining a simple `struct node`
- Printing the tree using in-order traversal
- Basic terminal visualization

---

## Background

This code was written as a practice exercise for a university course in **Data and Algorithms**. The goal is to get comfortable with:

- Pointers and dynamic memory allocation
- Recursive functions
- Tree traversal and node structures

---

## Compile and Run

```sh
gcc bst.c -o bst
/.bst
```
